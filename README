-Notes-

I looked all over out here to try and find some Windows templates that I liked and none of them seemed to get me where I wanted to go. So I created all of these. Feel free to contact me if you have any issues.

-Installation-

1) Install snmp informant std. 1.6 on your windows device. http://www.snmp-informant.com/snmp_informant-standard.htm
2) Drop the snmp_informant_standard_*.xml files into your \cacti\resource\snmp_queries directory on your cacti box.
3) Import the cacti_host_template_windows_host_-_snmp_informant.xml
4) Add a windows device and select Windows Host - SNMP Informant as device type
